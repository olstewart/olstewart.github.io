            <ul>
                <li>✅ Files and folders are lowercase without spaces</li>
                <li>✅ Site has sufficient contrast</li>
                <li>✅ Uses different fonts and colors</li>
                <li>✅ Has header, main, and footer</li>
                <li>✅ Header is formatted correctly</li>
                <li>✅ Footer is formatted correctly</li>
                <li>✅ Main is formatted correctly</li>
                <li><strong>CRAP:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Contrast:</strong> Contrast is good for the most part, but I think that the pink is a little hard to see against the purple background and it could be lighter.</li>
                        <li><strong>Repetition:</strong> The site is pretty consistent and all elements that perform the same function look similar</li>
                        <li><strong>Alignment:</strong> The elements on the site are aligned well and very few things look out of place or cramped.</li>
                        <li><strong>Proximity:</strong> All related elements are grouped together clearly.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Other comments:</strong> I like the boxes around the links in the navbar at the top! However, they take up a lot of space and can draw some attention away from the main content. Also, there should probably be a fall-back for the font used in the site in case it loads on a device with poor connection.</li>
