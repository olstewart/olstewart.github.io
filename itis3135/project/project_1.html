                <h3>Description:</h3>
                <p>Bones and Marrow: Infested is a game where you can choose 4 colorful characters with their own personalities and abilities. Go through 5 unique worlds with their own fun gimmick and boss, defeat the elites of the Vermin army and deposit their treasure, and meet your boss&#39;s quota before time up! </p>
                <p>This game was made as a fun start-up project using GameMaker Studio 2. It later evolved into a larger-scale game and has been in development for about 2 years now. The game has been developed by me and my co-partner, and we are hoping to release this game on Steam.</p>
                <h3>Design Process:</h3>
                <p>This was the first game I programmed using GameMaker Studio. Understanding how to make well-made and dynamic systems, such as collisions or state machines, was one of the largest hurdles for me as a developer. Additionally, not knowing how to properly structure my code and also the lack of documentation caused a lot of backtracking and frustrations with my partner jumping in and working on the project.</p>
                <h3>Outcome:</h3>
                <p>This game is still in development and I still have a lot to learn, but so far I have picked up on better habits as a developer and have picked up on the importance of great documentation and flexible features. I love this project as it is something that has been really personal to my heart and a real testament to my status as a developer. Can&#39;t wait to share more!</p>
