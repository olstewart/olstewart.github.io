                <h4>Occupation:</h4>
                <p>A junior at UNC Charlotte majoring in computer science; also, on top of that, a rising game developer. Interned at the HR office at Hafele America Co. over the summer.</p>
                <h4>Background:</h4>
                <p>I started developing games back in the 5th grade when I was introduced to programming through the block coding app, HopScotch. I fell in love with being able to program games and have family play them, seeing the fun they'd have. I would later move onto other block coding programs such as Scratch in middle school. Now I develop games using GameMaker Studio 2 and have been for the last 2 years.</p>
                <h4>Hobbies:</h4>
                <p>I am someone who enjoys the arts; frequently I draw at home, but on the occasion I will go out and doodle as well. I also love to cook and am trying to pick up new recipes where I can. I would like to one day make my own recipes from scratch.</p>
