                <h3>Description:</h3>
                <p>Five Nights at Fluffballs is a “Five Nights at Freddy’s” fan game where you try to survive the night against mascots trying to end your night here. Watch the camera and keep the mascots at bay. Five Nights at Fluffballs was created as a starter project for Nintendo’s Game Builder Garage. After essentially being dared. It took about two weeks to complete after learning how to use Game Builder Garage. </p>
                <h3>Design Process:</h3>
                <p>This was the first game I programmed in Game Builder Garage, requiring me to learn the program and how to use it properly. With the game being so new there weren't any tutorials on how to implement certain features online, all I had to depend on was the knowledge the program gave me and worked from there. An additional challenge on making a Five Nights at Freddy's fan game on Game Builder Garage was the lack of space, Game Builder Garage games only allow a certain amount of data to be taken up when making a game, this required me to find better ways to optimize the game in order to include all necessary features for a FNAF fan game. I ended up using the maximum amount of space available.</p>
                <h3>Outcome:</h3>
                <p>This project was a jumping off point of sorts to start developing larger games, I learned how to make more optimized systems and even creative ways to create effects that can’t normally be created due to limitations. This also allowed me to get a better grasp on programming as a whole, allowing me to dip my toes into other game engines. After developing its sequel, Five Nights at Fluffball’s 2, development on new games using Gamemaker Studio 2 began.</p>
