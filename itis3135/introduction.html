                        <li><strong>MATH 1242 - Calculus II:</strong> This class is a prerequisite for other math courses I need.</li>
                        <li><strong>ITCS 3112 - Design and Implementation of Object-Oriented Systems:</strong> I took this one because I heard it was a good elective.</li>
                        <li><strong>ITSC 3146 - Intro Oper Syst & Networking:</strong> I had to take this course but I was really interested in operating systems and their functions.</li>
