            <p>Purpose: Shows what the projects in question are, in detail</p>
            <p>Audience: Portfolio viewers</p>
            <p>Page content: Text, images, dropdowns and buttons</p>

            <p>Special Notes: The images on the page should be scrollable and clicking on an image thumbnail should bring you to a larger version of said image</p>
            <p>Dynamic Functionality</p>
            <p>I want there to be images that you can click on that expand into further details about the item. Similar to what you see in storefront web pages. I also want there to be image thumbnails that you can click on to expand them into bigger versions of the images.</p>
