            <h2>CRAP Website Discovery and Evaluation</h2>
            <h3><a href="https://www.thundertoadanimation.com/">Thundertoad Animations</a></h3>
            <p>This is the homepage for a small old animation company known as Thundertoad Animations. It is very simple website with mostly links and images of their single movie.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Contrast: The contrast in this website is variable, due to the background. In some places, the yellow text stands out well against the dark red, but neither it or the white text contrasts well against the lighter orange parts of the background. The blue underlines under the links do not contrast well against the background.</li>
                <li>Repetition: There’s a little bit of repetition, in that the yellow arrows used to travel to different parts of the website are often used as navigation links. There isn’t much repetition outside of that, however.</li>
                <li>Alignment: The content of the webpage is not well aligned at all which makes the page feel disorganized and jumbled. Also, on the links page, all of the links are centered text which just looks bad.</li>
                <li>Proximity: I think that this website uses proximity well. Content related to each other sticks together, and there are large gaps between unrelated groups of content.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3><a href="https://www.youtube.com/">Youtube</a></h3>
            <p>Youtube is a popular video sharing social media platform that mostly hosts videos and text-only comments.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Contrast: This website has quite high contrast, in the colors themselves and also in the contrast between smaller and larger items on the page.</li>
                <li>Repetition: All of the regular videos have the same size, all the shorts have a similar size, and all the playables have similar backgrounds. All buttons are also the same background and foreground color.</li>
                <li>Alignment: This website uses alignment relatively well, making the site more readable and organized.</li>
                <li>Proximity: This website also uses proximity well. Everything that is related to each other is grouped or lined up together, with a healthy distance between it and other unrelated content.</li>
            </ul>
